Few terms in DSA:

Time Complexity: O(N).  Only one traversal of the array is needed.
Auxiliary Space: O(1). No extra space is needed

Patterns in DSA:

1. Two pointers pattern, used to align 0's and 1's in ascending order in a given Array.

2. Three pointers pattern, used to align 0's, 1's and 2's in ascending order in a
   given Array.

3. Sliding window pattern, used to find a max number in a given range in Array.
   Used a technique of next greatest element here.
